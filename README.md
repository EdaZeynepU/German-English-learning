# React Project

This is a React project bootstrapped with Vite.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (version 6 or above) or yarn (version 1 or above)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

   ```
   cd react-project
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```
   yarn
   ```

### Development Server

To start the development server and view the application in your browser, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and provide you with a development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your browser to see your React application in action.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized and minified bundle of your application in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment

The contents of the `dist` directory can be deployed to any static file hosting service or server of your choice.
